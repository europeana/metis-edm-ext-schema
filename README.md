# metis-edm-ext-schema

Trial version with limited rules.

Still lacking support:
* Most EDM features as documented
* Closed objects

Further additions needed (these may also require inclusion in the EDM documentation below):
* Language restrictions
* The various record API V3 requirements (as warnings) 
* 3D profile
* IIIF profile
* OEmbed profile
* PID profile
* Technical metadata fields (profile)
* Others? Also see https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-profiles.

This project should replace the schema links on the EDM page of Europeana Pro 
(https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation)
